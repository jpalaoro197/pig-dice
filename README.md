# _Pig-Dice_

#### By _**Jacob Palaoro & Tyler Emmerson**_

#### _Description_

This is a Pig Dice game with options for playing with one die or two dice. Players take turns rolling a die or dice. They can decide to continue rolling to acrue potential points or "hold" and add those potential points to their score. Certain roll combinations, however, may cause a turn to end and all potential points to be lost.

*_Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":_
*_If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn._
*_If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
*_If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins._
